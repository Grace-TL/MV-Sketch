        MV-Sketch: A Fast and Compact Invertible Sketch for Heavy Flow Detection in Network Data Streams
</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Fast detection of heavy flows (e.g., heavy hitters and heavy changers) in
massive network traffic is challenging due to the stringent requirements
of fast packet processing and limited resource availability.  Invertible
sketches are summary data structures that can recover heavy flows with small
memory footprints and bounded errors, yet existing invertible sketches incur
high memory access overhead that leads to performance degradation.  We present
MV-Sketch, a fast and compact invertible sketch that supports heavy flow
detection with small and static memory allocation.  MV-Sketch tracks candidate
heavy flows inside the sketch data structure via the idea of majority voting,
such that it incurs small memory access overhead in both update and query
operations, while achieving high detection accuracy.  We present theoretical
analysis on the memory usage, performance, and accuracy of MV-Sketch.
Trace-driven evaluation shows that MV-Sketch achieves higher accuracy 
than existing invertible sketches, with up to 3.38$\times$ throughput gain.
We also show how to boost the performance of MV-Sketch with SIMD instructions.
