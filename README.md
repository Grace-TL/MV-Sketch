### Compile and Run the examples
MV-Sketch is implemented with C++. We show how to compile the examples on
Ubuntu with g++ and make.

#### Requirements
- Ensure __g++__ and __make__ are installed.  Our experimental platform is
  equipped with Ubuntu 14.04, g++ 4.8.4 and make 3.81.

- Ensure the necessary library libpcap is installed.
    - It can be installed in most Linux distributions (e.g., apt-get install
      libpcap-dev in Ubuntu).

- Prepare the pcap files.
    - We provide two small pcap files
      [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WLEjB-w4ZlNshl1vUMb98rrowFuMBWuJ/view?usp=sharing).
      You can download and put them in the "traces" folder for testing.  
    - Specify the path of each pcap file in "iptraces.txt". 
    - Note that one pcap file is regarded as one epoch in our examples. To run
      the heavy changer example, you need to specify at least two pcap files.
      

#### Compile
- Compile examples with make

```
    $ make main_hitter
    $ make main_changer
    $ make main_simd
```
- To compile the SIMD example, you need to make sure your CPU and compiler can support AVX and AVX2.
    - Check your CPU with the command to make sure the flags contain "avx" and "avx2"
    ```
    $ cat /proc/cpuinfo
    ```
    - The g++ compiler should have version above 4.8   


#### Run
- Run the examples, and the program will output some statistics about the detection accuracy. 

```
$ ./main_hitter
$ ./main_changer
$ ./main_simd
```

- Note that you can change the configuration of MV-Sketch, e.g. number of rows and buckets in the example source code for testing.
